# Sudoku
Welcome to the Sudoku project!

Sudoku is a popular puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with numbers. 
The objective of Sudoku is to complete the grid in such a way that every row, every column, 
and every one of the nine 3x3 subgrids (called "regions" or "boxes") contains all of the numbers from 1 to 9 without any repetition.

This simple program is designed to help you solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels.
